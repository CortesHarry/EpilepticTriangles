Small game that I made for CISC 1600: Introduction to Multimedia Programming in the Fall of 2015

The game can be played at http://cisc1600.sketchpad.cc/sp/pad/view/ro.46cEpTptnOn6weU/rev.3. 


For a cleaned-up version of the project I made during the Fall of 2015 in Cisc 1600 go into the unedited folder. 
For a commented out version that explains the game mechanics, variables, and functions of the same project go into the edited folder.
