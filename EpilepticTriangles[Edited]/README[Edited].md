# EpilepticTriangles
Small game that I made for CISC 1600: Introduction to Multimedia Programming in the Fall of 2015

The game can be played at http://cisc1600.sketchpad.cc/sp/pad/view/ro.46cEpTptnOn6weU/rev.3. 


This is the EDITED version of the source code. 
While this is saved as a .txt file this is a Processing file. See above link to be able to play the game. 
I added comments so that the viewer can understand the game mechanics, variables, and functions.
